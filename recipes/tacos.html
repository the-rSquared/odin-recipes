            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>    
    <h3>Meat</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pounds beef chuck roast</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <h3>Tacos</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>18 corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1 large white onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded queso asadero (white Mexican cheese) (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil</li>
        <li>Start the sauce: Add guajillo, arbol, and ancho chile peppers to the boiling water; boil for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, sear the meat: Rinse beef and pat dry with paper towels. Cut beef into chunks if desired, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>While the beef is searing, continue the sauce: Line a heavy cast-iron grill pan or griddle with aluminum foil and place over high heat. Arrange tomatoes in a single layer on top. Grill until tomato skin is burned on all sides and begins to peel, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place cooled chile peppers into a blender. Add vinegar, garlic, 2 teaspoons black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, oregano, and salt in a blender. Pour in the reserved 1/4 cup of chile water and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Strain chile sauce through a mesh strainer and pour over browned meat in the Dutch oven, turning the roast so it is completely covered with sauce; cover with a lid.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting meat every 45 minutes with sauce, until birria begins to fall apart, 3 to 4 hours. Remove the lid and bake, uncovered, until birria is crispy on top, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven, cover with 2 layers of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove meat to a cutting board and strain off any fat from the sauce. Shred meat with two forks, then return meat to the pot and stir with the sauce to combine.</li>
        <li>Assemble and heat tacos: Fill each tortilla with birria and top with Mexican cheese, chopped onion, and cilantro. Warm tortillas on a griddle, flipping until both sides are crispy and cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Serve with extra sauce on the side for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
